"""Preprocessor ABC — converts CanonicalSample + HF Processor into model-ready tensors.

A Preprocessor handles the model-family-specific tokenization, image processing,
and label masking required for VLM training. It also provides a collation method
to batch multiple preprocessed samples.

Built-in implementations:
  - ChatTemplatePreprocessor — uses processor.apply_chat_template(), works for
    all HF VLMs that support chat templates (LLaVA, Qwen2-VL, Gemma, etc.)
