"""DoRA: Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation.

Paper: Liu et al., "DoRA: Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation", ICML 2024
arXiv: 2402.09353

Key idea: Decompose pretrained weights into magnitude and direction components.
LoRA is applied only to the directional matrix, while the magnitude vector is
trained separately.  This mimics full fine-tuning's learning pattern more closely
than standard LoRA, yielding ~0.7% average improvement with zero extra inference
overhead (magnitude + direction can be merged back).
